# Hwk 5: Architected Plugin

## VisionAware
Our plugin, VisionAware lets users to change the background color of a webpage and is designed to make it easier for visually impaired users to view a webpage. Since color vision impairment (color blindness) affects people in different ways, Vision in aims provide better legibility by changing the color of a webpage and its font color. 

## Load the Extension (Installation)
Since we didnâ€™t publish our plugin, we suggest that you download our source code in our GitHub repo. Once downloaded, you open a new Chrome tab and visit **chrome://extensions/**. Be sure to enable  the _Developer Mode_ checkbox, and then click on _Load Unpacked Extension_ to select the extension file from your directory.

## How to Use
Once the extension is loaded, you can click on the extension and it will change the background color of the current page _black_ (the default color). The background color will remain even if you refresh the page. If users wish to change the default color, they can simply select a different background color, and click on the extension when you visit another site. This is ideal for users who have a specific visual impairment as they can specify their own default background colors without selecting from the dropdown menu constantly. 

From the first dropdown menu, you can select the type of color blindness (Protanomaly, which is a reduced sensitivity to red light, Deuteranomaly which is a reduced sensitivity to green light, Tritanomaly which is a reduced sensitivity to blue light, and Monochromacy which is a reduce sensitivity to all colors) Depending on the color blindness selected, the user can select the appropriate background color. For instance, a purple green color scheme will be more legible to red-green impaired users (http://colororacle.org/resources/2007_JennyKelso_ColorDesign_hires.pdf); hence, we have a green background and purple text option.
